# Rome v0.2 Tutorials


The following tutorials show how to use the Rome API. They focus on the higher abstraction layer of classes offered by Rome, what we call the Synd\* classes. By using the Synd\* classes developers don't have to deal with the specifics of any syndication feed. They work with normalized feeds, the Synd\* feeds. This makes it much easier to write applications that have to deal with all the variety of syndication feed types in use today.
