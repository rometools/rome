# ROME Development Process


We're welcoming our first external developer, [Nick Lothian](http://www.mackmo.com/nick/blog/) today, so we thought it would be good to set a few basic rules for this project. We don't want to be too formal, since we're still alpha, and trust our developer's common sense to "do the right thing".


 
* Please before commiting anything send an email in the rome developer lists to explain what you want to do
 
* When you create some new code, please javadoc it, and unit tests are welcome 
 
* If your code involves new functionality for end users, please document it on the wiki.
 
* and update the [RomeChangesLog](ChangeLog.html)
 
* I think that's it: Welcome to Rome
