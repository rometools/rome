*Open Source Research Prototypes using ROME



 * {{{http://www.infosys.tuwien.ac.at/prototype/morse/}MORSE}}\
 The {{{http://www.infosys.tuwien.ac.at/prototype/morse/}Model\-Aware Repository and Service Environment}} (MORSE) is a service\-based environment for the storage and retrieval of models and model\-instances at both design\- and runtime. Models, and model\-elements are identified by Universally Unique Identifiers (UUID) and stored and managed in the MORSE repository. The MORSE repository provides versioning capabilities so that models can be manipulated at runtime and new and old versions of the models can be maintained in parallel. MORSE exposes various services to runtime clients and modeling tools. For instance, a {{{http://www.infosys.tuwien.ac.at/m2projects/at.ac.tuwien.infosys.tholmes.morse/rs\-impl/}feed}} reflects the latest changes within the repository.

 * {{{http://www.blog\-city.com/}Blog\-City Ltd}}\
 Blog\-City.com has been using ROME for many months now, utilising both the core project and the Fetcher project to allow bloggers to run their own mini\-aggregators within their blog.

 * {{{http://www.reger.com/}Reger.com}}\
 All blogs running at reger.com include ROME feeds. With the custom ROME module we wrote entry data is included in the RSS feeds. DataBlogging allows people to append activity\-specific data to each of their entries. In addition to the pre\-built log types (Running Log, Biking Log, Movie Log, etc), users can create custom log types with whatever data fields they need. The module outputs those data fields. Users simply customize their log types, adding and removing fields, and then the RSS feed automatically includes it. An RDDL document for the namespace can be found at{{{http://www.reger.com/about/specs/entrydata.rddl}http://www.reger.com/about/specs/entrydata.rddl}} Thanks again for all of the help and for making ROME great!

 * {{{http://techrepublic.com.com/}CNET Networks/TechRepublic.com}}\
 CNET Networks uses ROME with an application called the RSS Harvester. The purpose of this application is to harvest a list of predefined RSS/ATOM feeds, saving all new items for each feed in a database. In addition, each feed has an associated keyword that allows for easy surfacing of harvested data. \
 Once the feed data has been collected, internal editors can surface links to the harvested data on the TechRepublic website by including a call to a JSP component. This component passes several parameters including the number of items to return, the number of items from a particular site and an associated keyword. For example, {{{http://techrepublic.com.com/2001\-10591\-0.html}http://techrepublic.com.com/2001\-10591\-0.html}} (see the section "More on ...") we surface related articles. \
 We are also using Rome for Re\-Blogging on TechRepublic.com. Users can start their own blogs on the site as well as choose to import an RSS feed from an existing blog such as blogger.com. When the user imports an existing blog we use Rome to parse the RSS/ATOM feed then convert it to a TechRepublic blog. Any new blog posts on the external blog are automatically imported to TechRepublic.

 * {{{http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/}Edmunds.com Inside Line}}\
 We are currently using ROME as our feed generator and as a feed parser. Currently we publish RSS feeds of our latest articles on www.insideline.com, however, we also use it to provide updates between our sites. For example, our community site {{{http://townhall\-talk.edmunds.com/}Townhall}} produces RSS feeds which we then parse using ROME on our {{{http://www.edmunds.com/insideline}Inside Line}} property. Rome has significantly speed up our development times thanks to its clean object model and its ability to generate multiple feed types.

 * {{{http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewArtist?artistId\=118405710}HBO Podcasts}} (iTunes Music Store Link)\

 * {{{http://newsrack.in/}NewsRack}}\
 Several organizations in the social development sector monitor news that is relevant to their work. This is a time\-consuming and laborious process for some groups, especially when the news is monitored, marked, cut, and filed using hard copies of newspapers and magazines. This process is very much the case in India. However, much of this work can be automated using web versions of newspapers and magazines. In this context, the broad goal of this project is to automate news monitoring. \
 NewsRack is a tool/service for classifying, filing, and long\-term archiving of news. Users specify filtering rules which are used to select relevant articles from incoming news feeds. The selected articles are then classified into various categories. This process is similar to the process of specifying email filters to pre\-sort incoming mail into various folders. \
 NewsRack is currently using Rome. I am looking for developers, so, if this project tickles you, please get in touch! \- Subramanya Sastry
