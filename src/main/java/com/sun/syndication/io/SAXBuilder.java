 *  This code is needed to fix the security problem outlined in http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/297714
 * 
 * Unfortunately there isn't an easy way to check if an XML parser supports a particular feature, so
 * we need to set it and catch the exception if it fails. We also need to subclass the JDom SAXBuilder 
 * class in order to get access to the underlying SAX parser - otherwise the features don't get set until
 * we are already building the document, by which time it's too late to fix the problem.
 * 
 * Crimson is one parser which is known not to support these features.
