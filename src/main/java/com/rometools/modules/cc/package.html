   This is a module for ROME that supports both the 
    <a href="http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/cc/">"CC" RSS1</a> module and the 
    <a href="backend.userland.com/creativeCommonsRssModule"> RSS 2 (and Atom)</a> 
    module in a unified manner. 

    <p>It does this by superimposing the "rome:creativecommon" namespace over both of them
    for the purposes of the module, and synchronizes them into a unified structure. For RSS2
    it attempts to correlate the license into a code-capable fashion. If the license link 
    goes to one of the standard licenses at creativecommons.org, it will populate the permissions
    based on it's know set (See License.Behaviour).</p>
    
    <p>The module has 2 fields on it. One is "allLicenses". This is simply an array of all licenses
    in a feed. The second one "licenses" contains licenses that apply to a specific element (feed or 
    entry). Licenses then contain "permits" and "requires" behaviours. If a license is used that
    the system can't determine anything about, these will be null. Zero-lenght means "known and
    empty."</p>
    
    <p>At this time, because of a ROME limitation, writing RSS1 feeds is not possible. However,
    if you read an RSS1 feed, you can convert it to an RSS2 feed properly.</p>
    
    <p>Sample Usage:
    <pre>
        
        CreativeCommons commons = new CreativeCommonsImpl();
        commons.setLicense( new License[]{ License.NONCOMMERCIAL } );
        // Note, you do not have to setAllLicenses right now. When the RSS1 functionality is
        // added, this will be required at the Feed level only.
        ArrayList modules = new ArrayList()
        modules.add( commons );
        syndEntry.setModules( commons );
        
        //Alternately, to get the module:
        CreativeCommons commons = (CreativeCommons) syndFeed.getModule( CreativeCommons.URI );
        
    </pre>
