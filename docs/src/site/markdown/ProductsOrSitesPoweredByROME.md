### Open Source Research Prototypes using ROME

-   [MORSE](http://www.infosys.tuwien.ac.at/prototype/morse/){.externalLink}\
    The [Model-Aware Repository and Service
    Environment](http://www.infosys.tuwien.ac.at/prototype/morse/){.externalLink}
    (MORSE) is a service-based environment for the storage and retrieval
    of models and model-instances at both design- and runtime. Models,
    and model-elements are identified by Universally Unique Identifiers
    (UUID) and stored and managed in the MORSE repository. The MORSE
    repository provides versioning capabilities so that models can be
    manipulated at runtime and new and old versions of the models can be
    maintained in parallel. MORSE exposes various services to runtime
    clients and modeling tools. For instance, a
    [feed](http://www.infosys.tuwien.ac.at/m2projects/at.ac.tuwien.infosys.tholmes.morse/rs-impl/){.externalLink}
    reflects the latest changes within the repository.

-   [Blog-City Ltd](http://www.blog-city.com/){.externalLink}\
    Blog-City.com has been using ROME for many months now, utilising
    both the core project and the Fetcher project to allow bloggers to
    run their own mini-aggregators within their blog.
-   [Reger.com](http://www.reger.com/){.externalLink}\
    All blogs running at reger.com include ROME feeds. With the custom
    ROME module we wrote entry data is included in the RSS feeds.
    DataBlogging allows people to append activity-specific data to each
    of their entries. In addition to the pre-built log types (Running
    Log, Biking Log, Movie Log, etc), users can create custom log types
    with whatever data fields they need. The module outputs those data
    fields. Users simply customize their log types, adding and removing
    fields, and then the RSS feed automatically includes it. An RDDL
    document for the namespace can be found
    at[http://www.reger.com/about/specs/entrydata.rddl](http://www.reger.com/about/specs/entrydata.rddl){.externalLink}
    Thanks again for all of the help and for making ROME great!
-   [CNET
    Networks/TechRepublic.com](http://techrepublic.com.com/){.externalLink}\
    CNET Networks uses ROME with an application called the RSS
    Harvester. The purpose of this application is to harvest a list of
    predefined RSS/ATOM feeds, saving all new items for each feed in a
    database. In addition, each feed has an associated keyword that
    allows for easy surfacing of harvested data.\
    Once the feed data has been collected, internal editors can surface
    links to the harvested data on the TechRepublic website by including
    a call to a JSP component. This component passes several parameters
    including the number of items to return, the number of items from a
    particular site and an associated keyword. For example,
    [http://techrepublic.com.com/2001-10591-0.html](http://techrepublic.com.com/2001-10591-0.html){.externalLink}
    (see the section \"More on \...\") we surface related articles.\
    We are also using Rome for Re-Blogging on TechRepublic.com. Users
    can start their own blogs on the site as well as choose to import an
    RSS feed from an existing blog such as blogger.com. When the user
    imports an existing blog we use Rome to parse the RSS/ATOM feed then
    convert it to a TechRepublic blog. Any new blog posts on the
    external blog are automatically imported to TechRepublic.
-   [Edmunds.com Inside
    Line](http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/){.externalLink}\
    We are currently using ROME as our feed generator and as a feed
    parser. Currently we publish RSS feeds of our latest articles on
    www.insideline.com, however, we also use it to provide updates
    between our sites. For example, our community site
    [Townhall](http://townhall-talk.edmunds.com/){.externalLink}
    produces RSS feeds which we then parse using ROME on our [Inside
    Line](http://www.edmunds.com/insideline){.externalLink} property.
    Rome has significantly speed up our development times thanks to its
    clean object model and its ability to generate multiple feed types.
-   [HBO

### Sites using ROME

-   [Yabot](http://www.yabot.net/){.externalLink}\
    Yabot is a news service currently available in five editions (May
    2008).

    Discovering and implementing ROME made Yabot\'s feed aggregation
    faster and easier. In previous versions we rendered the XML our
    selves but with ROME now doing most of this work developers can
    focus on presentation and integration features. Thanks!

    otherwise would have been. \--Bill Kocik, Sr. Software Engineer,

    feeds. We love it. - Travis
-   [NewsRack](http://newsrack.in/){.externalLink}\
    Several organizations in the social development sector monitor news
    that is relevant to their work. This is a time-consuming and
    laborious process for some groups, especially when the news is
    monitored, marked, cut, and filed using hard copies of newspapers
    and magazines. This process is very much the case in India. However,
    much of this work can be automated using web versions of newspapers
    and magazines. In this context, the broad goal of this project is to
    automate news monitoring.\
    NewsRack is a tool/service for classifying, filing, and long-term
    archiving of news. Users specify filtering rules which are used to
    select relevant articles from incoming news feeds. The selected
    articles are then classified into various categories. This process
    is similar to the process of specifying email filters to pre-sort
    incoming mail into various folders.\
    NewsRack is currently using Rome. I am looking for developers, so,
    if this project tickles you, please get in touch! - Subramanya
