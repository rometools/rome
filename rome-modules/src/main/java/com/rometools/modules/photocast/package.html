  This package represents the Apple iPhoto Photocasting 0.9 namespace support.
  Sample Usage:
<xmp>
        SyndFeed feed = input.build(  new File( "/foo.rss" ) ) );
        List entries = feed.getEntries();
        for( int i =0; i < entries.size() ; i++ ){
            System.out.println( ((SyndEntry)entries.get(i)).getModule( PhotocastModule.URI ) );
        }
        
        // or to create a photocast module:
        
        SyndFeed myFeed = new SyndFeedImpl();
        myFeed.getModules().add( new PhotocastModuleImpl() ); 
        // you need this as a placeholder so the version gets in the feed.
        
        SyndEntry myEntry = new SyndEntryImpl();
        PhotocastModule pm = new PhotocastModuleImpl();
        pm.setUrl( new URL("http://foo.com/img.jpg" ) );
        pm.setThumnail( new URL("http://foo.com/img-small.jpg" ) );
        pm.setCropDate( new Date() );
        pm.setPhotoDate( new Date() );
        pm.setMetaData( new PhotoDate(), "Some comments that I think always get ignored." );
        myEntry.getModules().add( pm );
