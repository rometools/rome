    This is a ROME plug in that implements the Content RSS extension.
    http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/
    
    Note, this supports both the "Original" syntax via the ContentItem object 
    and the "New" Syntax via the ".getEncodeds()" method on the ContentModule.
    
    <h2>Sample Usage:</h2>
    <pre>
        SyndFeedInput input = new SyndFeedInput();
        SyndFeed syndfeed = input.build(new XmlReader(feed.toURL()));

        Module module = syndfeed.getModule("http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/");
        ContentModule content = (ContentModule) module;
        
        Iterator it = content.getEncodeds().iterator();
        System.out.println( it.next() );
