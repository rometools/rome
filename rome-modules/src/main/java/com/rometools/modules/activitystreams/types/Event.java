 * The "event" object type represents an event that occurs in a certain place during a particular

 * The object type URL for the "event" object type is
 * "http://activitystrea.ms/schema/1.0/event".


 * An event has the following additional components:



 * <blockquote class="text">
 * <dl>
 * <dt>Start Date and Time</dt>
 * <dd>The date and time that the event begins. Represented in JSON as a property called
 * "startTime" whose value is JSON string containing a W3CDTF timestamp. [TODO: Reference
 * W3CDTF spec.] [TODO: Include prose describing how to represent just a date vs. a date and time.]</dd>
 * <dt>End Date and Time</dt>
 * <dd>The date and time that the event ends. Represented in JSON as a property called
 * "endTime" whose value is JSON string containing a W3CDTF timestamp. [TODO: Reference
 * W3CDTF spec.] [TODO: Include prose describing how to represent just a date vs. a date and time.]</dd>
 * </dl>
