/**

 * The "file" Object type represents some document or other file with no additional machine-readable
 * semantics.


 * It is intended that this type be used as a base type for other Objects that manifest as files, so
 * that additional semantics can be added while providing a fallback ability for clients that do not
 * support the more specific Object type.


 * The "file" Object type is identified by the URI "http://activitystrea.ms/schema/1.0/file".


 * A file has the following additional components:



 * <blockquote class="text">
 * <dl>
 * <dt>Associated File URL</dt>
 * <dd>The URL of the file described by this Object Construct. Represented in JSON by a property
 * called "fileUrl" whose value is a JSON string containing the URL.</dd>
 * <dt>File MIME Type</dt>
 * <dd>The MIME type of the file described by this Object Construct. Represented in JSON by a
 * property called "mimeType" whose value is a JSON string containing the MIME type.</dd>
 * </dl>
 * </blockquote>
