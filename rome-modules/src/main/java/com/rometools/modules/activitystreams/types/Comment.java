/**

 * The "comment" object type represents a textual response to another object.


 * The comment object type MUST NOT be used for other kinds of replies, such as video replies or
 * reviews.


 * The "comment" object type is identified by the URI
 * "http://activitystrea.ms/schema/1.0/comment".


 * A comment has the following additional components:



 * <blockquote class="text">
 * <dl>
 * <dt>Subject</dt>
 * <dd>The subject of the comment. Represented by the Name component of the base Object Construct.
 * Many systems do not have the concept of a title or subject for a comment; such systems MUST omit
 * the Name component. Processors SHOULD refer to such comments as simply being "a comment", with
 * appropriate localization, if they are to be described in a sentence.</dd>
 * <dt>Content</dt>
 * <dd>The content of the comment. Represented in JSON as a property called "content" whose
 * value is a JSON string containing a fragment of HTML that represents the content. Publishers
 * SHOULD include any markup necessary to achieve a similar presentation to that on the publisher's
 * own HTML pages, including any links that the service automatically adds. Processors MAY remove
 * all HTML markup and consider the comment to be plain text.</dd>
 * </dl>
