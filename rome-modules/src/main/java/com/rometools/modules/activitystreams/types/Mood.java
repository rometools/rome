 * Mood describes the mood of the user when the activity was performed. This is usually collected
 * via an extra field in the user interface used to perform the activity. For the purpose of this
 * schema, a mood is a freeform, short mood keyword or phrase along with an optional mood icon
 * image.


 * Moods are included via a mood element in the namespace "http://activitystrea.ms/context/".


 * The content of the mood element is the mood keyword or phrase.


 * The mood element may have an optional "icon" attribute which contains the URL of a mood
 * icon image. The mood icon image SHOULD be small and appropriate to be displayed alongside the
 * mood keyword at a normal text size.
