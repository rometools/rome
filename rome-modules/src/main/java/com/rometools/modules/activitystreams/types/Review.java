/**

 * The "review" object type represents a primarily prose-based commentary on another object.


 * The "review" object type is identified by the URI
 * "http://activitystrea.ms/schema/1.0/review".


 * A review has the following additional components:



 * <blockquote class="text">
 * <dl>
 * <dt>Title</dt>
 * <dd>The title of the review. Represented by the Name component of the base Object Construct. Many
 * systems do not have the concept of a title for a review; such systems MUST omit the Name
 * component. Processors SHOULD refer to such reviews as simply being "a review", with appropriate
 * localization, if they are to be described in a sentence.</dd>
 * <dt>Content</dt>
 * <dd>The content of the comment. Represented in JSON as a property called "content" whose
 * value is a JSON string containing a fragment of HTML that represents the content. Publishers
 * SHOULD include any markup necessary to achieve a similar presentation to that on the publisher's
 * own HTML pages, including any links that the service automatically adds. Processors MAY remove
 * all HTML markup and consider the comment to be plain text.</dd>
 * <dt>Reviewed Object</dt>
 * <dd>The Object Construct representing the item that this review applies to. Represented as the In
 * Reply To Object component of the base Object Construct.</dd>
 * <dt>Rating</dt>
 * <dd>A rating for the item, given as a number between 1.0 and 5.0 inclusive with one decimal place
 * of precision. Represented in JSON as a property called "rating" whose value is a JSON
 * number giving the rating.</dd>
 * </dl>
