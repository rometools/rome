/**

 * The "song" Object type represents a song or a recording of a song.


 * Objects of type Song might contain information about the song or recording, or they might contain
 * some representation of the recording itself. In the latter case, the song SHOULD also be
 * annotated with the "audio" object type as described in <a class='info'
 * href='#audio'>Section&nbsp;3.2.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Audio</span><span>)</span></a>
 * and use its properties. This type should only be used when the publisher can guarantee that the
 * object is a song rather than merely a generic audio stream.


 * The Object type URL for the "song" Object type is
 * "http://activitystrea.ms/schema/1.0/song".


 * A song has no additional components.
