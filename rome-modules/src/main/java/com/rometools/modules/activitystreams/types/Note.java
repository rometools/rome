/**

 * The "note" Object type represents short-form text messages. This Object type is intended for use
 * in "micro-blogging" and in systems where users are invited to publish short, often plain-text
 * messages whose useful lifespan is generally shorter than that of an article or weblog entry.


 * A note is similar in structure to an article, but it does not have a title and its body tends to
 * be shorter. Applications will often display the entire content of a note in an activity stream
 * UI, whereas they MAY display only the title or the title and summary for a weblog entry.


 * The "note" Object type is identified by the URI "http://activitystrea.ms/schema/1.0/note".


 * A note has the following additional components:



 * <blockquote class="text">
 * <dl>
 * <dt>Content</dt>
 * <dd>The content of the comment. Represented in JSON as a property called "content" whose
 * value is a JSON string containing a fragment of HTML that represents the content. Publishers
 * SHOULD include any markup necessary to achieve a similar presentation to that on the publisher's
 * own HTML pages, including any links that the service automatically adds. Processors MAY remove
 * all HTML markup and consider the comment to be plain text.</dd>
 * </dl>
 * </blockquote>
