/**

 * The "status" Object type represents a human-readable update of the author's situation, mood,
 * location or other status.


 * A status is similar in structure to a note, but carries the additional meaning that the content
 * is primarily describing something its author is doing, feeling or experiencing.


 * A consumers MAY consider the content of the most recent status object it encountered to be the
 * user's current status, unless the most recent status update is old. When a status becomes too old
 * is not defined by this specification.


 * The "status" object type is identified by the URI
 * "http://activitystrea.ms/schema/1.0/status".


 * A status has the same components as a note.
