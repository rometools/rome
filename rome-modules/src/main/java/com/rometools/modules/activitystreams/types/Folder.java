/**

 * The "folder" object type represents a collection of files or media objects. This is similar to
 * the "photo album" object type, but not specifically representing a collection of "photos."


 * The "folder" object type is identified by the URI
 * "http://activitystrea.ms/schema/1.0/folder".


 * A folder has the following additional components:



 * <blockquote class="text">
 * <dl>
 * <dt>Preview Image Link</dt>
 * <dd>A Media Link Construct describing an image file that can be used as a preview image for the
 * folder. Represented by the Representative Image component of the base Object Construct.
 * Processors MAY ignore thumbnails that are of an inappropriate size for their user interface.</dd>
 * </dl>
