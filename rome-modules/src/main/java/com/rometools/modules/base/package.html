    <p>Sample Useage:
    <pre>
        
        SyndEntry entry = new SyndEntryImpl();
        // set up the entry...
        Vehicle vehicle = new GoogleBaseImpl();
        vehicle.setMake("Honda");
        vehicle.setModel("Insight");
        vehicle.setYear( new Year("2000"));
        List modules = new ArrayList();
        modules.add( vehicle );
        entry.setModules( modules );
        
        //Optionally, to get Google Base information from a Feed:
